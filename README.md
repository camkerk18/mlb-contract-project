# mlb-contract-project

Created: September 2024

Page and project currently under construction!

The NHL, NBA, and NFL all have salary caps. However, the MLB does not. Is there a way to take the statistics of MLB players and create groups by which to classify them by for future contract purposes. The idea is to take past season and career data of players to create tiers by which to rank current players. From there contract minimums and maximums can be created and prediction for future contracts can be made.

Code, results, findings, and analysis coming soon.
